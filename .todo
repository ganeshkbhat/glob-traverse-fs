PLANNED

    - [D] Traverse directories single level or recursively
    - [D] Return Result as flat array or nested array or json
    - [T] Search Files and Folders based on text or regex
    - [T] Return File properties
    - [D] Run Callbacks on specific folders
    - [D] Run Callbacks on specific files
    - [T] Search and Traverse concurrently
    - [T] Add filter function (along with search) folders and files while traversing; using traversing and searching technique both
    - [T] Segregate traversing functionality into different function to allow isolation to traverse objects/ json objects
